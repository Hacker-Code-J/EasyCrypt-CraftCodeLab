% Ambient Logic

\begin{note}[Logics]
\EasyCrypt has four logics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item a \textbf{Probabilistic Relational Hoare Logic (pRHL)} for proving relations between pairs of procedures
	\item a \textbf{Probabilistic Hoare Logic (pHL)} for proving probabilistic facts about single procedures
	\item an \textbf{Ordinary Hoare Logic (HL)}
	\item an \textbf{Ambient Higher-order Logic} for proving mathematical facts and connecting judgements from the other logics
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[*] Based on higher order classical logic
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Proofs and Theories]
\ \begin{itemize}
	\item Proofs are structured as sequences of lemmas
	\item Lemmas are proved using tactics, as in Coq
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[*] Simple ambient logic goals can be proved using SMT solvers 
	\end{itemize}
	\item \EasyCrypt theories may be used to group definitions, modules and lemmas together
	\item Theories may be specialized via cloning
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[*] Any axioms must then be proved
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Types}
\EasyCrypt's types include basic types like \begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{unit} (which only has the single element \texttt{()}),
	\item \texttt{int},
	\item \texttt{bool} and
	\item \texttt{real},
\end{itemize} as well as \begin{itemize}
\item $\texttt{t}_1*\texttt{t}_2\cdots*\texttt{t}_n$ and
\item function types $\texttt{t}_1\to\texttt{t}_2$.
\end{itemize} `$*$' has higher precedence than $\to$, and $\to$ is right associative. Thus \[
\texttt{t}_1*\texttt{t}_2\to\texttt{t}_3\to\texttt{t}_4
\] means $(\texttt{t}_1*\texttt{t}_2)\to(\texttt{t}_3\to\texttt{t}_4)$. A value of this type is a function that takes in a pair $\texttt{(x,y)}$, where $\texttt{x}$ has type $\texttt{t}_1$ and $\texttt{y}$ has type $\texttt{t}_2$, and returns a function that takes in a value $\texttt{z}$ of type $\texttt{t}_3$, and returns a result of type $\texttt{t}_4$.
